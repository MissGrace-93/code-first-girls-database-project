## Introduction
A basic relational database created as my final project for the Code First Girls Introduction to Data and SQL course.
The database is based on the IIHF Men's World Championships 2021.
The database details all the information on the teams, players and games played at the competition.

## Technologies
The database was created using MySQL and MySQL Workbench 8.0

## Using the Project
To replicate or use this database, copy & paste the SQL scripts into the MySQL command line or MySQL Workbench.

## Scripts
The repository incldues MySQL scripts for:
- Table Structures
- Stored Functions
- Stored Procedures
- Views
- Queries & Subqueries

## Sources
The project was created for my final project as part of the Code First Girls Introduction to Data & SQL short course. You can find out more about Code First Girls and the courses
